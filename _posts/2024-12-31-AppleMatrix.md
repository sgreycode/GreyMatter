# AppleMatrix Screen Generator

Howdy folks, I was using my old iMac one day recently, for the first time in a quite a while â€“ I was looking up something for AppleSoft coding that had popped into my head while away from my home office -, and when I was done I moved my mouse to the top right corner where my HotCorners will launch the screensaver. 

Well, I forgot that I have a Matrix style screensaver in use. Always loved the Matrix screens. I wondered if there was a little program for AppleSoft so back onto the net I went, and found absolutely nothing! That seemed pretty strange, so I searched some more. Still nothing.

The AppleSoft world needed a little program to generate Matrix style screens, so I wrote one using AppleWin emulator and I tested it on an Apple ][e. This was lots of fun to build, and I am quite happy with it, and will likely work on it in the future to improve it, but for now you can use the link below to pop over to the repository. You can copy and paste it into an emulator like AppleWin, or type it into your own vintage Apple computer. You can do whatever you like with it, I only ask that you leave my name in the code listing ðŸ™‚

UPDATE: As it turns out, after another web search, someone had written something already, and you can check that out here [Another Matrix Screen Generator](https://github.com/neilk/apple-ii-matrix/)
